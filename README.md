# VGG16-model-for-Binary-Image-Classification
The shared script shows how to train and evaluate a pretrained Keras model. The dataset I prepared and used in this experiment can be downloaded from the Zenodo platform: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18233912. You can use the shared code for your own experiments with Keras models and transfer learning technique.
